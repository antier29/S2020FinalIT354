      Trust the process! When doing a full face of makeup you might look crazy at first but it will all come together.<br>
        Start by filling in your brows. You will need to set them in place with a brow gel. 
        <br>
        Next you need to prime your eyes with concealer and set with powder. Take a fluffy blending brush and add a warm red-brown shade 
        to your crease. Really smoke this out as it is our base shade. Next take a smaller blending brush and use a darker red-brown shade in the lower crease. 
        You want to place this color just below the previous one without going to high. <br>
        <br>
        Next take a flat shader brush and some light concealer. If you have a shade that is too light for you, use it! Start by placing a dot on your eyelid and look up. The concealer will mark a part higher up on your eye. 
        Use this as a guide for how high up you should place it. Set with a white eyeshadow. We want the color to pop! 
        Take you finger and place a pinky white glitter shadow right over where we cut the crease. <br> <br> 
        Take a dark brown shade and place in the outer 3rd of your eye. Use a liquid eyeliner to make a tiny wing. We do not want this to 
        draw attention away from the eyeshadow. 
        Prime your face and put on foundation. Use a blender instead of a brush to give a flawless finish. Make sure the sponge is damp though!
        Conceal undereyes and highlight in the areas shown. Blend blend blend! 
        Set the face with a light layer of powder.
        <br>
        <br>
        Use an angled cheek brush when applying bronzer and contour, it makes it easier. Apply blush to the apples of the cheeks. Use a small brush to apply highlighter to the highpoints of your face.
        <br>
        <br>
        Set the face and add mascara and fake eyelashes. Line your lips and put on some gloss. Now you are done! You are now ready!

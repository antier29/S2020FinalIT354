        The goal for this look is to make it seem like you are not wearing any makeup. 
        <br>
        First you start by filling in your brows. You want to be light handed with this and only fill in the 
        sparce areas. After you do that you can start on your foundation.big-circle<br>
        I would reccommend a BB-cream or a light coverage foundation. Glossier's Perfecting Skin Tint would be perfect.<br>
        <br><br>
        Next if you still need more coverage add some concealer to your undereyes. Once you have completed that 
        you then want to set the face with a translucent powder. Laura Mercier's would be a perfect choice.
        <br><br>
        Next add some highlighter. Then you will want to add a sheer layer of blush. Now you can stop here 
        and finish with setting spray but if you want you can add some mascara too. Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara is one of
        my favorites and it gives you volume and length.
